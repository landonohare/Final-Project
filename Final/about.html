                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I was raised in Lincoln, Kansas, a small but charming town, and attended Lincoln Junior Senior High School. My initial post-secondary education began 
                    at Fort Hays State University, where I originally pursued a major in Biology with the ambition of becoming a Physician's Assistant. However, my interests 
                    evolved, leading me to switch my focus to the fields of Computer Science and Physics, aligning more closely with my passion for technology and innovation. 
                    This shift in academic direction is aimed at preparing me for a career in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. My academic journey is planned to 
                    culminate in 2027 with my graduation. In the interim, I'm looking forward to transferring to Kansas State University in the Spring of 2025 to further enrich 
                    my educational experience. Beyond academics, I have a diverse array of interests. I am an avid video game enthusiast, which not only serves as a leisure 
                    activity but also subtly sharpens my analytical and strategic thinking skills. Additionally, I enjoy spending quality time with friends and maintaining my 
                    physical fitness through weightlifting, which I find essential for mental and physical well-being. In terms of technical skills, I have developed proficiency 
                    in several programming languages, including C++, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java. These skills not only reflect my technical competence but also my 
                    adaptability and eagerness to learn and grow in the ever-evolving field of technology. Looking ahead, I have set my sights on joining the Air Force, aspiring 
                    to serve as a Physicist or Nuclear Engineer at the rank of a 2nd Lieutenant. This goal is fueled by my passion for serving the country and my interest in the 
                    practical applications of physics and engineering in the military context. My interpersonal skills have been significantly honed through my experience working 
                    as a Certified Nursing Assistant in a nursing home. This role not only developed my empathy and communication skills but also demonstrated my ability to thrive 
                    in high-pressure environments. It's an experience that has profoundly shaped my approach to teamwork and collaboration. Academically, I have maintained a GPA 
                    of 3.3, which is on a consistent upward trajectory, reflecting my dedication and continuous improvement in my studies. This academic performance is a testament 
                    to my commitment to excellence and my ability to balance various aspects of my life effectively. In summary, my journey from Lincoln, KS, to my current academic 
                    and career aspirations is a reflection of my evolving interests, dedication to continuous learning, and commitment to leveraging my skills and experiences in 
                    meaningful ways.
